The data simulates a typical Business environment dataset related to Human Resources information. It contains 3 data sets:

Employee data, with information like, name, Date of Birth, Date of hire, Department, etc.
Action data, indicating actions like, hiring, promotions, demotions, attrition.
Performance data. For each employee for each period.
The 3 data set can be related through the Employee ID.
The current data set spans over 10 periods (2015-2024) with an average active employees of 1000 per year.
The replacement rate (new hire and attrition) is set to be about 5% per year.
The age of employment is coherent with the typical distribution of ages.
The likelihood of promotions is linked to performance rate.

There are 2 planted biases in the data:

A Gender Bias (Female(1) employees tend to get better performance ratings)
A Race Bias (Asians (1) are more likely to be promoted)
